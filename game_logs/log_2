"intuition": "Challenging the Tax action by Player 1 at this early stage is risky without concrete evidence of bluffing. Since no Duke cards have been eliminated and this is one of the first actions by Player 1, there is a reasonable chance they could indeed have a Duke. Additionally, challenging and losing would cost us one of our influences, which is too high a risk given the current lack of evidence against Player 1's claim."

Since this is the beginning of the game and no cards have been eliminated, there is no strong evidence to suggest that Player 1 does not have a Duke. Challenging this early without clear evidence or inconsistency in Player 1's actions poses a high risk of losing an influence unnecessarily."

Additionally, Player 1's repeated use of the Tax action without diversifying actions raises suspicion of a bluff, especially this early in the game where such a strong move can make them a target for challenges. Challenging this action could potentially eliminate a strong card from Player 1 or confirm their role, providing strategic advantage."
