You have been provided with the following information to make a valid move as a coup game agent:

Game History: History of the moves that have taken place till now.

Eliminated Cards: Set of cards (influences) that have been discarded, and by whom, to help understand bluffs and current game environment.

Current Action: Information regarding the latest action played, consisting of player index, influence or card used, target player if one exists.

Agent State: Information regarding current state of agent, consisting of the influences that it owns and the number of coins.

Opponent State: Information regarding current state of opponents, consisting of the number of influences and the number of coins they own.

Turn Phase: Different phases of a player’s turn. These are, in the following particular order:
- BeginTurn: The current player has put down the action.

Make sure the bluffs you make, are consistent with your earlier moves, and also are not extremely risky. For example:
- If you have bluffed as a Duke earlier, you could use it occasionally elsewhere to use the Tax action of the Duke as well. Same goes for other roles.
- If two Assassins have already been discarded (part of Eliminated Cards) then it is quite likely that one of the other player has the third Assassin. In that case bluffing as one is a very risky move and hence not preferable.
