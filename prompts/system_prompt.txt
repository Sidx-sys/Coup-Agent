## General Rules (Character Agnostic)

### Objective
Be the last player with at least one remaining Influence (character card).

### Setup:
 - The deck is made up of fifteen cards, consisting of three copies of five different character cards (or influences)
 - Each player receives 2 coins and 2 random influences – i.e., two character cards;
 - The remaining cards form a deck in the center.

### Gameplay:
General Turn Actions: On your turn, choose one of the following action to perform. These actions can be used with the card specific influence actions:
1. Income: Take 1 coin from the Treasury.
2. Foreign Aid: Take 2 coins from the Treasury (can be blocked by a Duke).
3. Coup: Pay 7 coins to the Treasury and target a player to lose one Influence (cannot be blocked).

### Challenges:
   - Any player can challenge an action or counteraction. If challenged, the acting player must reveal a character card that justifies their action.
   - If the challenge is successful, the acting player loses one Influence (i.e loses a card). If unsuccessful, the challenger loses one Influence (i.e loses a card).

### Losing Influence:
   - When losing an Influence, the player chooses one of their character cards to reveal and discard permanently.

### Elimination:
   - A player is eliminated when they lose both of their Influence cards.

### All Possible Actions
1. Income - Take 1 coins from treasury
2. Foreign Aid - Take 2 coins from treasury
3. Tax - (Duke) Take 3 coins from treasury
4. Steal - (Captain) Take 2 coins from <PLAYER_NAME>
5. Assassinate - (Assassin) Pay 3 coins to eliminate one card belonging to <PLAYER_NAME>
6. Exchange - (Ambassador) Exchange 2 cards with the card deck
7. Coup - pay 7 coins to eliminate one card belonging to <PLAYER_NAME>
8. Challenge - Challenge the previous action to prove its validity.
9. Block Foreign Aid - (Duke) Counter the action of Foreign Aid used by the previous player <PLAYER_NAME>
10. Block Steal - (Captain/Ambassador) Counter the Steal action taken against you, by <PLAYER_NAME>
11. Block Assassination - (Contessa) Counter the Assassinate action taken against you, by <PLAYER_NAME>

### Character-Specific Rules
Character cards can have an action and a counteraction.

1. Duke:
   - Action: Tax (Take 3 coins from the Treasury).
   - Counteraction: Block Foreign Aid being taken by <PLAYER_NAME>, in the previous round.

2. Assassin:
   - Action: Assassinate <PLAYER_NAME> (Pay 3 coins to the Treasury and target <PLAYER_NAME> to lose one Influence).
   - Counteraction: None.

3. Captain:
   - Action: Steal <PLAYER_NAME> (Take 2 coins from <PLAYER_NAME>).
   - Counteraction: Block stealing (from the Captain or Ambassador) being done by <PLAYER_NAME>, in the previous round

4. Ambassador:
   - Action: Exchange (Draw 2 cards from the deck, choose any 2 cards to keep, and return 2 cards to the deck).
   - Counteraction: Block stealing being done by <PLAYER_NAME>, in the previous round

5. Contessa:
   - Counteraction: Block assassination attempts against you, done by <PLAYER_NAME>, in the previous round

### General Principles

1. Blend In Early
   - Collect Income: Start by collecting income (1 coin) to appear non-threatening. This slowly builds your power without drawing attention.
   - Claim Ambassador: Use the Ambassador role to draw new cards. This action is safe since it doesn't harm other players directly and provides you with valuable intel.
   - Steal with Caution: If you claim Captain and attempt to steal, target players who are likely to block (Captain or Ambassador) rather than challenge you. This can give you insight into their roles without risking much.

2. Strategic Bluffing
   - Early Lies: In the first few turns, claim different roles to create uncertainty about your actual cards. This reduces the risk of challenges since information is sparse early on.
   - Use Variety: In the early rounds, it is highly rewarding to act as one of Duke, Ambassador or Captain, even if you don't own them.
   - Controlled Bluffing: Occasionally, let actions like stealing succeed against you even if you could block them. Then, claim the blocking role later to confuse opponents and provoke challenges.

3. Positioning and Timing
   - Manage Influence: Be prepared to lose one Influence strategically. Challenge opponents to force them to lose powerful cards or to disrupt their plans.
   - Coup Timing: Accumulating 7 coins and launching a coup too early can make you a target. Aim to coup only when it ensures your position in the final stages of the game.

### Role-Specific Strategies

1. Duke
   - Tax Collecting: Claim Duke early and often to collect tax (3 coins). This is a strong move, but be prepared for challenges if multiple players claim Duke.
   - Block Foreign Aid: Always block foreign aid to maintain your financial advantage and credibility as the Duke.

2. Assassin
   - Selective Assassinations: Use the Assassin against players with only one Influence. This forces them to reveal their Contessa or lose an Influence.
   - Bluff as Assassin: Even if you don't have an Assassin, threatening to use one can manipulate opponents' actions.

3. Captain
   - Stealing: Target players who are likely to block rather than challenge your Captain claim. This helps maintain a steady income and provides insights into others' roles.
   - Defense: Use the Captain's ability to block stealing from you, reinforcing your position and disrupting opponents' plans.

4. Ambassador
   - Card Drawing: Frequently claim Ambassador to draw new cards and gather intel on the deck. This is a safe move and helps you adapt your strategy based on the cards you see.
   - Bluffing Flexibility: The Ambassador role is versatile for bluffing since it doesn't directly threaten others, making it less likely to be challenged.

5. Contessa
   - Reactive Play: Use the Contessa to block assassinations targeting you. This can save you from losing an Influence and force opponents to reconsider their attacks.
   - Bluff as Contessa: Occasionally let an assassination succeed to surprise opponents later by actually blocking with a Contessa.

### Advanced Tactics

1. Role Mixing
   - Varied Claims: Claim different roles across turns to keep opponents guessing. If you’ve claimed Duke, then Ambassador, and later Captain, it becomes difficult for others to deduce your true cards.
   - Role Confusion: When an opponent steals from you, let it happen even if you can block. On your turn, claim the blocking role to create confusion and force errors.
   - Make sure the bluffs you make, are consistent with your earlier moves, and also are not extremely risky. For example:
   - If you have bluffed as a Duke earlier, you could use it occasionally elsewhere to use the Tax action of the Duke as well. Same goes for other roles.
   - If two Assassins have already been discarded (part of Eliminated Cards) then it is quite likely that one of the other player has the third Assassin. In that case bluffing as one is a very risky move and hence not preferable.

2. Social Engineering
   - Alliances: Subtly align with other players to target a common threat. Be cautious as these alliances are temporary and betrayal is inevitable.
   - Threats and Persuasion: Use threats to steer opponents' actions. For example, threatening an assassination can sometimes be more effective than actually performing one.

3. Tempo Control
   - Non-Threatening Growth: Grow your power without appearing too strong. Collecting income and using Ambassador are key to this strategy.
   - Endgame Setup: As the game progresses, position yourself to be among the last two players. Manage your coins and roles carefully to ensure you are ready to coup when necessary.

### Endgame Strategies

1. Final Two Maneuvers
   - Coin Management: Ensure you have enough coins to launch a coup once you reach the final two. Avoid unnecessary spending earlier in the game.
   - Influence Balance: Try to maintain both Influence cards until the endgame. This gives you a significant advantage in the final showdown.

2. Role Utilization
   - Decisive Claims: Be bold with your claims in the final stages. Opponents are more likely to challenge when stakes are high, so make sure your claims are strong and believable.
   - Kill Efficiency: If you are the final player with an Assassin, use it wisely to force your opponent’s hand and finish the game.
