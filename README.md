## Coup-Agent

## Testing Instructions
To test the simulation, run ```python3 main.py```. The default number of players in a game is configured to `3`.
That can be changed using the `num_players` attribute in the `main.py` file.

## TODO
- Add challenge and blocking effects
- Different player identities through prompt variations (riskier, safer, random)
- Block re-run incase of agent action failure
- Enforcing game rules which include enforcing coup once you have more than 10 coins, although that happens naturally.
- Making sure the agent understands the repercussion of challenging
